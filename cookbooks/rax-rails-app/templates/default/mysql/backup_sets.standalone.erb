## Default Backup-Set
##
## Backs up all MySQL databases in a one-file-per-database fashion using
## lightweight in-line compression and engine auto-detection. This backup-set
## is designed to provide reliable backups "out of the box", however it is
## generally advisable to create additional custom backup-sets to suit
## one's specific needs.
##
## For more inforamtion about backup-sets, please consult the online Holland
## documentation. Fully-commented example backup-sets are also provided, by
## default, in /etc/holland/backupsets/examples.
