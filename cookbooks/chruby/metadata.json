  "long_description": "# chruby cookbook\n\nInstalls the Chruby utility for changing between Ruby versions.\nChruby is a vastly simplified rbenv - it's about 90 lines of code, and\nvery easy to understand.\n\n# Requirements\n\n- Depends on the `ark` cookbook and the `ruby-build` cookbook.\n- Tested on:\n  - CentOS 6.3 and 6.4\n  - CentOS 5.8\n  - Ubuntu 12.04\n  - Ubuntu 10.04\n\n# Usage\n\nInclude the `chruby` recipe in your run list.  This will make the\nchruby tool available to every shell, and make the embedded Ruby from\nthe Omnibus install available for use.\n\nChruby uses `ruby-build` to make Ruby versions available on the OS.\n\nThe version to build are defined in the node attribute `node['chruby']['rubies']`\n\nThis is a hash of Ruby versions, with a boolean flag, specifying whether the version should be installed.\n\nFor example, the cookbook default says:\n\n    default['chruby']['rubies'] = {'1.9.3-p392' => true}\n\nIf you want to disable this, set the value to false in a role or a wrapper cookbook.  For a role:\n\n```\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"chruby\" => {\n    \"rubies\" => {\n      \"1.9.3-p392\" => false,\n      \"1.9.3-p429\" => true\n    },\n    \"default\" => \"1.9.3-p429\"\n  }\n)\n```\n\nFor a wrapper cookbook:\n\n```\nnode.set['chruby']['rubies'] = { \"1.9.3-p392\" => false, \"1.9.3-p429\" => true }\n```\n\nThese Ruby versions are installed using the LWRP provided by the `ruby_build` cookbook.\n\nEnsure you set an explicit dependency on the `chruby` cookbook if you are using a wrapper cookbook.\n\n# Attributes\n\n- `node['chruby']['version']` - the version of Chruby to install.  Default is 0.3.4.\n- TODO: `node['chruby']['gpg_check']` - run the GPG check to verify the release was not tampered with.\n- `node['chruby']['use_rvm_rubies']` - make Rubies installed using RVM available to chruby.\n- `node['chruby']['use_rbenv_rubies']` - make Rubies installed using Rbenv available to chruby.\n- `node['chruby']['auto_switch']` - enable automatic switching between Ruby versions per https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#auto-switching\n- `node['chruby']['rubies']` - an hash of Rubies / Booleans values to install using the `ruby-build` LWRP, and make available to chruby.\n- `node['chruby']['default']` - specify the default Ruby version for every shell.\n \n# Recipes\n\n## Default\n\nInstalls the chruby utility, and makes it available to every shell.  If Chef was installed with the Omnibus installer, make embedded Ruby available as an option for usage.\n\n## System\n\nBuilds and makes available the Ruby versions listed in the `node['chruby']['rubies']` attribute, using the `ruby-build` LWRP.\n\n# Author and License\n\n- Author: Stephen Nelson-Smith (LordCope) - Atalanta Systems Ltd (<cookbooks@atalanta-systems.com>)\n\nCopyright 2013, Atalanta Systems Ltd \n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
